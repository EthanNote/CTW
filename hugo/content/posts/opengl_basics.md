## Vertex shader & fragment shader

> A helpful way of thinking about the difference between shaders that deal
with vertices and fragment shaders is: vertex shading (including tessellation
and geometry shading) determine where on the screen a primitive is,
while fragment shading uses that information to determine what color
that fragment will be.
