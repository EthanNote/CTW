## Vertex shader & fragment shader

> A helpful way of thinking about the difference between shaders that deal
with vertices and fragment shaders is: vertex shading (including tessellation
and geometry shading) determine where on the screen a primitive is,
while fragment shading uses that information to determine what color
that fragment will be.

## Bind & edit approach

> Generally speaking, you will bind
an object in two situations: initially when you create and initialize the data
it will hold; and then every time you want to use it, and itâ€™s not currently
bound.
